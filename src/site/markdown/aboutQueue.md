# What is a Queue?

A queue is a data structure with a specific size. You can only insert elements at the end and delete (get) elements from the beginning. Queues are not good at saving data for a long period of time because you can only get the first element and put things in at the end. (FIFO-Princip)

Our project includes two implementations of the Queue. One as a String Queue and one as Integer Queue.
